// boolean is a fancy way of saying true or false, yes or no, 1 or 0

// Arrays can store both strings, numbers, and additional arrays inside of them, 
// which allows them to store data. The 0th position on the array is actually the first
// value in the array. 

// Array.length holds the value of the length of the array. For example, arrayvariable.length
// is equal to 5.
