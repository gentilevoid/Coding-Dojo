//Day one of class, we will be doing all of our work in Visual Studio. 
//We have no group code review for this week, but we do have a discussion board, 
//which will not be due until 2 AM EST

//HTML is the fire-frame of the front end, and CSS is the decoration of that
//skeleton. Old websites that are just run on HTML will look lik old-fashioned 
//sites with no style.
